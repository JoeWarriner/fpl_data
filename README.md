## FPL Predictions - Learning Project

This is a learning project that I add to from time to time. I've mainly used it to explore technologies I'm using at work, or that I'm just curious about.

Long term the idea is to predict scores in Fantasy Premier League (and maybe use some kind of optimisation algorithm to actually pick a team / select an optimal trade).

It _isn't_ currently a very useful app. Individual parts work - there's a web app, some prediction models and a pipeline to extract data from the FPL api. But the different components don't currently work together and the code is a bit of mess. At some point I'd like to spend some time to make the whole thing into a "finished product", but really the main goal has just been to learn different technologies.

Learning goals so far:
- [x] Create Django app from scratch
- [x] Learn about using Postgres as a Django backend.
- [x] Learn about migrations and management commands in Django
- [x] Explore some methods for forecasting / prediction.
- [x] Practice using Django templating / bootstrap
- [x] Use a pipeline orchestrator (apache airflow) to manage ETL on Google Cloud Platform.
- [ ] Deploy app to cloud.
- [ ] Set up CICD pipeline.
- [ ] Add user accounts - get some practice with Django authorisation / middleware.
- [ ] Overengineer performance xD - i.e. explore kubernetes, caching, etc.
- [ ] Create a dynamic front end in a javascript framework.
